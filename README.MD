# TODO_fullstack_app

Brief description of your project goes here. Explain what it does and why it is useful.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Follow these simple steps to get started.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Docker installed on your system. If you do not have Docker, please follow the instructions on the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started) to install it.

### Running the Application

1. **Start Docker Containers**

First, you need to build and run the Docker containers which include all the necessary environments for the application. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this project. Then, execute the following command: 

    docker-compose up

This command builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service. Wait for the process to complete before moving to the next step.

2. **Setting Up the Frontend**

Once the Docker containers are up and running, you'll need to set up the frontend part of the application. Open a new terminal window or tab and navigate to the frontend directory from the root of the project:

    cd frontend

After navigating into the frontend directory, install the necessary dependencies and run the development server by executing:

    npm run dev

This command will start the frontend development server, usually accessible via `http://localhost:3000` or another port specified in the terminal output.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use the application, including any configurations, features, and functionalities users should know about.
